Extract ToMoCoMD QuBiLs-MIDAS Command Line Interface files here, but DO NOT replace 
the headings.txt  or the tomocomd_qubils.in files. They are already configured to run ElectroPredictor 
in the most efficient way. If the headings.txt is changed, ElectroPredictor 
will not work since the file contains the relevant topographic descriptors needed for the modelling.
DO NOT CHANGE THE FILES OR THE APPLICATION WILL NOT WORK. 

You can download the files for ToMoCoMD QuBiLs-MIDAS Command Line Interface (CLI) at 
the following link: http://tomocomd.com/software/qubils-midas
