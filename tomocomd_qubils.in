# Specify the option(s) of headings of QuBiLS-MIDAS descriptors to be calculated. Several options separated by comma can be specified (e.g., 5,nChiral_Duplex_MIDAS_3DMDs).
# If the option 1 is specified, then the remaining options will be not considered.
# If the option 2 is specified, then the options 4 and 6 already are considered.  
# The following options are available:
#	1 - no headings will be calculated
#	2 - all the predefined lists of headings will be calculated
#	4 - all the predefined lists of headings corresponding to QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs will be calculated
#	5 - the user-specified headings in the 'headings.txt' file provided with the program will be calculated
#	6 - one or more of the following predefined lists of headings must be specified: 
#		nChiral_Duplex_MIDAS_3DMDs: it indicates that 'non-chiral keep-all (and neighborhood) total (and local) bilinear, quadratic and linear QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs' will be calculated
lists_of_headings											5
# This parameter is only considered if the option 5 detailed above, for the 'lists_of_headings' property, is specified. 
#	-1 indicates that all the user-specified headings will be computed at the same time.
#	Other value indicates the number of user-specified headings that will be computed at the same time. That is, several blocks of headings from the original list will be built, whose size will be the specified value.
